# Usage / Maintenance

## Usage

### Opening Closing

Unscrew pressure valve plug (blue) or insert vacuum adapter plug (red) to open the vent so it's easier to remove or insert flanges

Ensure inside of the tube is grease as well as the o-rings

Areas cover with grease are clear out of any debris

### Check sealing

It is recommended to check if it seals with manual vacuum pump before each submersion.&#x20;

### O-rings

{% hint style="danger" %}
Use plastic tools, NOT steel or other hard tools, to remove the O-rings from the aluminum sealing flange. Hard tools can create scrapes that will compromise sealing ability.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Always inspect the O-rings before operation in water and especially when replacing the end-caps, aluminum flanges, or penetrators. Any dust, hair, or other particles can cause a leak.
